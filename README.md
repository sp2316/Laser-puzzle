A laser-puzzle game implemented using c# and Unity.

**Logline**
Puzzle game with the combination of “Lazors” and “Unblock Me!”

Clear all levels.

**General Description**
Enigma is a puzzle game that combines the games “Lazors” and “Unblock Me”. The player's main goal is to clear all the levels. The game's main mechanic is to drag/move tiles around to direct the laser from source to a specified destination using the refractive and reflective tiles. The level completes once the player guides the laser to its destination. In addition, the game will contain other features to make the game more challenging such as color splitters, rotating tiles, different color lasers with multiple destinations, etc.
